A web server in Elixir.

This is a toy project for me to dive into Elixir and learn some Erlang in the process. I started by porting [Elli](https://github.com/knutin/elli). From that I stripped out a few things to reduce the scope of things I needed to learn. The things omitted are:
* SSL
* Handover for things liek websockets
* Chunked transfer
* Timing
* Events

I'm sure some of these things will make their way back in as I keep messing with this. My goal is to learn to write idiomatic Elixir and Elli is like a small understandable project to work from.
